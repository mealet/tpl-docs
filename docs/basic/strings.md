# Strings
**Strings** in `tpl-lang` compiler is similar as C programming language. <br/>
The main mechanics here: every symbol is a `char`, and string is just a pointer to chars array. <br/>

To define string constant just use double quotes:
```tpl-lang
"Something here"
"Hello World!"
"Do you reading this?"
```
